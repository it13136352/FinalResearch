<Sentence61>Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are highly vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. </Sentence61>
<Sentence62>In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, a systematic security implementation must be adopted to the existing ad-hoc technologies. </Sentence62>
<Sentence63>In this paper, the authors attempt to use a TRUST based authentication mechanism, to detect and prevent the potential attacks on Ad hoc networks, especially for Denial of Service (DOS) and Blackhole attacks. </Sentence63>
<Sentence64>Thus providing the associated security needed in order to build up relationships among each other to communicate.The authors have proposed a modified AODV routing protocol with calculating a heuristic trust matric. </Sentence64>
<Sentence65>The proposed mechanism will detect the attack by calculating the trust parameters and if a node is suspected as an attacker, the security mechanism will isolate it from the network before communication is established.2 authorsPrabath Lakmal RupasingheSenior Lecturer/Consultant/Security ResearcherShashika LokuliyanaLecturer at Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology,Sri LankaTrust Based Framework for Handling Communication Using Social Networks as Applied to Mobile Sensor Based Indoor Navigation System(Link)International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor NavigationOctober 28, 20142 authorsPrabath Lakmal RupasingheSenior Lecturer/Consultant/Security ResearcherIain Murray AMA/Professor at Curtin University of TechnologyDecentralized peer to peer web caching for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (iCache)(Link)IEEE20132 authorsPrabath Lakmal RupasingheSenior Lecturer/Consultant/Security ResearcherRajitha TENNEKOONAssistant Lecturer at Sri Lanka Institute of Information TechnologyRisk Inventory based approach to manage risks in Business OrganizationsPGIS Conference, University of Peradeniya20142 authorsPrabath Lakmal RupasingheSenior Lecturer/Consultant/Security ResearcherRohan SamarasingheSenior Lecturer at SLIITBuilding Essential BPM Capabilities to Assist Successful ICT Deployment in the Developing Context: Observations and Recommendations from Sri Lanka(Link)GLOBDEV 2012December 16, 2012A national level analysis commenced in Sri Lanka in August 2012, where an investigation into the status of ICT enabled process improvements began to take place. </Sentence65>

<Sentence72>Blind and Low Vision users are prominently in need of indoor positioning and navigating systems as indoor navigation is a significant issue. </Sentence72>
<Sentence73>Most of the efforts in creating such systems are using MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Networks) as the base technology. </Sentence73>
<Sentence74>However the properties of MANET’s inherently provide greater challenges in areas like security, reliability and performance. </Sentence74>
<Sentence75>Most of research work was done on those different challenges in isolation. </Sentence75>
<Sentence76>A holistic approach to address all these challenges in an implementation appears to be rare.Ad-hoc collaboration is usually an unplanned interaction or created "immediately on the fly". </Sentence76>
<Sentence77>In MANET networks Authentication and access-control trust relations established through, on-line- available evidence, may be short-term and largely peer-to-peer, where the peers may not necessarily have a relevant network that can be placed into a recognizable trust hierarchy. </Sentence77>
<Sentence78>Trust relations involving a captured node need to be invalidated, and new trust evidence need to be collected and evaluated to maintain node connectivity in the ad-hoc network This paper present the framework on Trust Relations based on friendships mechanism which is adopted from the theory of small-world phenomenon (i.e. six degrees of separation) initiated by Milgram, to provide rapid authentication.Continuity Efficient, Rapid Authentication is needed in practical implementations of an Indoor navigation system. </Sentence78>
<Sentence79>Particularly when Low vision users are dependent on such system, a rogue node can be hazardous. </Sentence79>
